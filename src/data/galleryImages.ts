    title: 'Chenni',
    synopsis:
      "Play ‘Chenni’ tells the story of a Kannad girl named Chenni, born into a Dalit family in a remote village in Karnataka. Her father, Kariappa, and her mother, Sabri, are deeply religious people who believe in God and blindly follow social customs and religious practices. When Chenni falls seriously ill at a very young age, her parents, instead of seeking medical treatment, take her to a temple priest. The priest compels them to dedicate little Chenni to God, making her a Basvi. The Basvi tradition is a social system in which girls are symbolically married to God and, after attaining the age of eighteen, are made available to physically satisfy Brahmin guests.  Chenni becomes a victim of these rigid customs and oppressive social systems. Exploited by thousand-year-old rituals and beliefs, she ultimately commits suicide in defiance of the abhorrent feudal system. Her death serves as a powerful foreshadowing of the collapse of that system, perhaps marking the final nail in its coffin.",

    synopsis:
      'Sadhonbabu is a bachelor who is extremely fond of auctions and regularly visits auction houses. He is a self-centred individual, but his greatest weakness is his constant doubt and suspicion. One evening, after returning from his office, he discovers a tree branch lying inside his room. Curious and disturbed by this strange sight, he questions his servant, Pocha. Pocha claims he did not notice any such branch, so Sadhonbabu calls his neighbour Mukundo to discuss the matter. Mukundo, who often mocks and teases Sadhonbabu, plants fear in his mind by suggesting that the branch could be a bomb and that someone might be trying to kill him. Already a fearful man plagued by doubts, Sadhonbabu becomes terrified and reveals to Mukundo that years ago he had quarrelled with an anti-social man named Madhu during a card game, after which Madhu had threatened to kill him. Thus, the simple tree branch deepens Sadhonbabu’s fear and suspicion.\n\nA few days later, upon returning from work, Sadhonbabu finds a box wrapped in brown paper lying on his table. He enquires about it from Pocha, who tells him that Dhona, the servant of another neighbour, delivered it. Sadhonbabu immediately calls Dhona to clear his doubts and learns that a man named Bomba, dressed in a black suit, instructed Dhona to deliver the box carefully to Sadhonbabu. This information terrifies him further, and he becomes convinced that the box contains a bomb. He asks Pocha to inspect the box, but Pocha refuses. The next morning, Pocha notices that the box is no longer on the table, and Sadhonbabu tells him that Madhu came during the night and took it away.\n\nSoon after, auctioneer Kumud visits Sadhonbabu to enquire about the box and informs him that he had sent an antique Italian clock wrapped in brown paper. Sadhonbabu is left speechless, having already drowned the suspicious box in the river Ganga in the middle of the night.',

    title: 'The Father',
    synopsis:
      'The Father is a play first written in 1887 by the famed and prolific Swedish playwright August Strindberg. It presents a tense battle of wills between a husband and wife as they argue over their daughter’s future.  The adapted Bengali play “The Father” is set in a family home in Panaji, in pre-independent Goa, in the year 1950. Daniel Maurice D’Costa, a Captain in the Goan Army and an astrophysicist, is trapped in a bitter marriage with a woman named Silvia. When the Captain and his wife disagree about the future education of their daughter, Elina, the couple grow even more distant. The Captain wants Elina to go to Bombay to study and become a teacher, while Silvia wants her to stay in Panaji and become an artist. The Captain lashes out against the female forces in his life, telling Silvia that she gave up her rights when she married and became financially dependent on her husband.  However, Silvia plants a devastating suspicion in her husband’s mind by suggesting that Elina is not his daughter after all. She then sets out to convince the new physician in town that the Captain is going mad. When the Captain learns of her plan, he loses his temper and reacts by throwing a lamp at her. This violent act makes him realise he has lost control, and he begins to rapidly descend into mental decline. Meanwhile, Silvia’s brother, Professor Peter Gomes, recognises—and half admires—the cunning game his sister has played to rid herself of her domineering husband and regain her rights. Ultimately, forced into a straitjacket, the Captain admits defeat to his wife’s dominance—“You could hypnotize me when I was wide awake, so that I neither saw nor heard, only obeyed”—and suffers a fatal stroke and dies. The play also mentions the Prophet Ezekiel’s words: “Only a fool can say that he is my father.” It becomes clear that even a tiny drop of doubt can create a vast ocean of doubts.',

    title: 'The Storyteller',
    synopsis:
      '“Childhood should be carefree, playing in the sun; not living a nightmare in the darkness of the soul.” — Dave Pelzer.  The play ‘The Storyteller’ follows the life of Anthony Peck, a writer based in Darjeeling who writes stories for children—and, more importantly, tells stories to those children whose childhood has become a nightmare. One day, the Darjeeling police arrest Anthony and his younger brother, Michael, on charges of murdering three people: two children and one man. Another girl is still missing. The accusations seem bizarre, because the murders reportedly occurred in the same manner Anthony has described the killings of children in several of his stories.  During interrogation, Additional Superintendent of Darjeeling Police Anita Bansal employs every possible method to make Anthony confess. As the questioning unfolds, Anthony begins narrating a few of the stories Anita refers to—stories that expose child abuse and the darkness of broken childhoods. That night, inside the cell, Anthony kills his younger brother Michael and confesses that he has committed four murders. Yet during his confession, he insists that he never killed any children—he claims he protected them. He reveals that two of the children were killed by their relatives, and that the third child is still alive, saved by him from being killed by her foster parents. Through this, Anthony points to the brutal consequences of a stubborn society—one that repeatedly fails to help helpless children who are tortured and abused. Acting on Anthony’s description, the police locate the third child and also find three corpses behind his house.  Anthony further reveals that he and his brother were themselves viciously tortured and abused by their foster parents. He admits to killing his foster parents, and also confesses to killing the uncle of the second child, who had murdered the child near the toy train track. Anthony’s violence extends even to Michael—his own brother—because Michael had taken money to kill the third child. In the end, unexpectedly, Anthony is shot by the police. However, his stories remain alive among thousands of poor children, inspiring them to live with dignity. Anthony’s stories, he believes, will inspire someone in the future to become a protector of vulnerable children and continue the legacy.',

    synopsis:
      'Drona Parva is regarded as one of the most significant parvas of the Mahabharata, as several crucial incidents occur within it. Among them, the demise of Abhimanyu stands out as one of the most important. His death is particularly significant in the context of the Mahabharata war because he was the first member of the Pandava family to be killed by the Kauravas.  In this play, Dr. Sisir Kumar Das presents the emotions and deep self-introspection of Uttara (the wife of Abhimanyu), Subhadra (the mother of Abhimanyu), and Draupadi following Abhimanyu’s death on the thirteenth day of the war. After his death, haunting questions arise: Why did this war happen? Why are we the ones suffering? Draupadi responds by explaining that the war was fought against Adharma, which had to be eradicated from the earth. She further reflects that the war was driven by her own desire for revenge, by a clash of egos between brothers, and that such a war inevitably demands sacrifices.',
